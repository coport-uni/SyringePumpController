"""Defensive test guarding the milestone boundary (LearnedPatterns W4).

Plunger initialization (``initialize``) and absolute step-based motion
(``move_to_steps``) have shipped. Stall-current commissioning
(``set_stall_current_for_syringe``), volume-based aspirate/dispense,
abort, and step-mode reconfiguration are intentionally absent — if a
future commit accidentally adds one before its HIL plan is ready, this
test fails loudly rather than letting a half-finished method ship.
